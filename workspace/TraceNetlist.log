When simulating a layout, all traces are considered.
If simulating from schematic, any net that has the same connections in both the layout and schematic will be considered.
In order to be simulated as transmission lines, a trace must have a line type.
If there is no information in this log about a particular schematic design, it means there was no equivalent layout.
If there is no information in this log about a particular schematic net, it means there was no eqiuvalent net in the layout.
